# Projet-QCMs-info

## Project Overview

This project is designed to create a software tool that generates multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in both AMC (Auto Multiple Choice) and Moodle formats from given code snippets. This tool aims to assist educators in generating quizzes for assessing student knowledge in programming courses effectively and efficiently.

## Features

- **Generation of MCQs in AMC and Moodle formats:** Supports the creation of quizzes in two popular formats which can be imported directly into corresponding platforms.
- **Support for multiple programming languages:** Utilizes Docker to run snippets in various programming languages, ensuring flexibility in question generation.
- **Web-based and CLI versions:** Provides both a command-line interface for quick generation and a web-based interface for ease of use with a graphical user interface.
- **Customizable Question Generation:** Allows users to define custom function calls and input code snippets to generate tailored questions and answers in LaTeX format.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python:** [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads)
- **Docker:** For desktop interface installation, visit [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Required Python Libraries

```bash
pip install docker
pip install mako
pip install argparse
pip install flask  # Only for the web-based version
```

### Running the Application

#### Command Line Interface

1. Navigate to the `ShellProgram` directory.
2. Run `main.py` with the necessary arguments to generate the MCQs.

   ```bash
   python main.py [arguments]
   ```

   The required arguments include:
   - Question name
   - Output format (AMC or Moodle)
   - Programming language key
   - Path to the code file
   - Path to the execution file
   - Path to the incorrect answers file
   - Question type (only for Moodle)

#### Web-based Interface

To use the web-based interface, you can utilize the provided scripts depending on your operating system:

##### For Windows:

1. Navigate to the `GUI` directory.
2. Run the `[WEB-UI] run.cmd` script to start the web application. This script will automatically open your default web browser to the application and start the server.
   
   ```cmd
   [WEB-UI] run.cmd
   ```

##### For Linux:

1. Navigate to the `GUI` directory.
2. Run the `[Linux_only].sh` script to start the web application. This script initializes the server and you may need to manually open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
   
   ```bash
   bash [Linux_only].sh
   ```

3. Access the web interface through your browser to input the details and generate the MCQs. If the script does not automatically open your browser, you can manually enter the URL `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser to access the application.

## Usage

- **Generate MCQs:** Input the code snippet, function calls, and incorrect answers. The tool generates questions in LaTeX format which can then be compiled to PDF for AMC or exported to XML for Moodle.
- **Customize Questions:** Through the provided interfaces, you can customize the MCQs by changing the programming languages, types of questions, and more.

## Output

The generated files will be placed in the `Outputs` directory or can be downloaded directly from the web interface, depending on the version used. These include LaTeX files and code snippets prepared for import into AMC or Moodle.
